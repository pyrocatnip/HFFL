            History of the United States Football League
        </h1>
            <p>
                The <b><a href="United States Football League.html">United States Football League</a></b> was founded in 2017 as a spring football league. The league held its first season in 2020 which included eight teams split into two conference. The league would see a sustained success that had previosuly been thought to be impossible due to the numerous failed spring football leagues that had come and gone before. The league was able to survive past its first couple of seasons of unprofitability, and was able to begin a period of growth starting in the 2024 season. The league would then expand in 2025, marking the first time a startup league had been able to do so. The league would expand two additional times in 2028, and 2031 respectively. The USFL is currently the second most profitable American football league in the world, after the NFL.

                The USFL was announced in March of 2017 as a spring football league that would not try to compete with the National Football League. The league would hold its inaugural draft in May of 2019, and would play its first season the year after. The league consisted of eight teams: the Alabama Rocketeers, the Boston Minutemen, the Carolina Wildcats, the Chicago Tornadoes, the Cincinnati Royals, the Miami Sharks, the New York Sentinels, the Orlando Sun, and the <a href="Union City Red Devils.html">Union City Red Devils</a>. During the period in between the end of the Draft and the beginning of the season, each team held training camps and were given time for the players to meet each other, practice and begin to bond; and for the front office to begin making tactical decisions for the upcoming season.

                The league would implement a salary cap in order to ensure parity amongst the teams in the league. The teams were split into the Eastern and Western Conferences with each team playing each team twice for a total of 16 games. The season itself would last a total of 17 weeks due to the addition of a bye week to give players and staff a week off. Initially, the league was structured similarly to the National Football League, with the owners of the teams being given final say over all matters in regards to the club. The club owners were also given the final say on all league matters, with coaches and players having little say on issues such as relocation, or renaming a franchise. In addition, a Commissioenr was appointed by the league owners, and would be the final authority on all league business operations and disciplinary matters.

                The league began its first season in February of 2020, and would come to an end in the middle of May. Each team also played four preseason games with the final game coming two weeks before the start of the regular season. This gave the coaches a chance to cut the roster to 53 active players, and gave the public the chance to see what the new league had to offer. Attendance during the first season exceeded expectations with the average attendance being 24,591 per game. Attendance would decrase for some of the franchises such as in the case of the Orlando Sun, however they did drop too far from what was expected by the league and its owners. After only a single season questions began to loom over a possible expansion, with media figures speculating on where the next potential franchsies could be located.

                In August of 2023, a poll was conducted on the <a href="USFL Football App.html">USFL app</a> in order to gauge fan opinion on a potential expansion to the league from 8 teams to potentially either 12 or 16 teams. Fans also had the chance to vote on cities that could potentially be sites for new franchises.
