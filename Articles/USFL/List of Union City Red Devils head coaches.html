                    The 2020 season was the first season Hamilton served as the head coach of the Red Devils. He led the team to a disappointing 4-12 record, finishing 3rd in the Eastern Conference, and failing to make the playoffs. The next season Hamilton would improve by two games to a 6-10 record, once again placing 3rd in the Eastern Conference. In 2022, the team would again improve to an 8-8 record, still failing to make the playoffs. The 2023 season would prove to be a low point for the early history of the Red Devils. The team would go 3-13, and would place last in the Eastern Conference. Following this record, the Red Devils would earn the first overall draft pick. The next season was the high point during the Hamilton era. The team would go 10-6 and finished first in the Eastern Conference for the first time. This was the first time in franchise history that team would make it to the playoffs. In their first ever playoff game; which was also the <a href="2024 USFL National Championship.html" title="2024 USFL National Championship">National Championship</a>, the Red Devils lost in 37-31 with a 99-yard punt return on the first play of overtime to the Miami Sun.

                    Following their heartbreaking loss in their first ever playoff apperance, the Red Devils would fail to make the playoffs during the remainder of the Hamilton era from 2025 until his firing in 2028. The team would go 7-9 in the 2025 season, and then collapsed, going 4-12 and then 5-11 in Hamilton's final two full seasons as head coach. Going into the 2028 season pressure began to mount and rumors of a possible firing if the team failed to perform emerged to the media during the offseason. The rumors would come true as Hamilton would be fired following an 0-10 start to the 2028 season, with Offensive Coordinator Allen Sexton promoted to interim head coach.
